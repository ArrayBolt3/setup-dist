Connect to the public Tor network now?

By default, Tor does not try to hide the fact that you are using it. If this concerns you, select "No" now. Then, select the menu option "Tor is censored or dangerous in my area" and follow the instructions.

Ultimately, the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor users there are near you and the more diverse their interests, the safer it will be to use it. Convince other people to use Tor!

Note: whonixsetup enables Tor networking by uncommenting "DisableNetwork 0" in /etc/tor/torrc.

Maybe your Whonix-Gateway has only one network card attached? Most likely there
is something wrong with your /etc/tor/torrc.

You can open /etc/tor/torrc in the terminal:
    sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc

Or, if you are using a graphical Whonix-Gateway:
    Start Menu -> Applications -> /etc/tor/torrc

Running:

   sudo service tor restart

might help with troubleshooting.
