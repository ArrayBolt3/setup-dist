If your firewall works by blocking ports, then you can tell Tor to only use the ports that your firewall permits by adding "FascistFirewall 1" to your /etc/tor/torrc configuration file.

By default, when you set this Tor assumes that your firewall allows only port 80 and port 443 (HTTP and HTTPS respectively).

If you want to be more fine-grained with your controls, you can also use the ReachableAddresses config options, e.g.:
ReachableDirAddresses *:80
ReachableORAddresses *:443

You can open torrc by using editor nano.

   sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc

Or, if you are using a graphical Whonix-Gateway.

    Start Menu -> Applications -> /etc/tor/torrc
