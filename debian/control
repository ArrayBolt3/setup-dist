Description: First Time Connection Setup
 When Whonix starts for the first time, it won't automatically connect to the
 public Tor network. This is useful for users who want to hide Tor from their
 ISP. setup-dist is automatically started, which educates about different
 methods to connect (public Tor network, bridges, etc.).
 .
 Also automatically starts the Whonix Repository Tool (if installed), so the
 user can decide whether to use Whonix's Repository and if yes, choose which
 one.
